# Quantification of rain in dPCRs

Ever wondered how to quantify the rain in your dPCR?

Here is a straightforward and simple approach:

1. Download the RFU files from the QIAcuity Software Suite v3.1.0.0 or use one of the .zip archive from the examples.

2. Upload the .zip archive to [the app](https://thundert.shinyapps.io/dpcr-rain-quant/). Currently supported fluorescence channels are *Green*, *Yellow*, *Orange*, *Red*, *Crimson*, *Far Red* and *Reference*. If other channels are detected, this will display as *Unknown channel*.
   
3. Play around with the thresholds and see the fraction of rain partitions.


More features to come. Stay tuned!
